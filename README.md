# Conversational AI Agent – Project 

### Smart TV OS – AI Voice-to-Action System

---

## ✅ 1. Feature Overview

The Conversational AI Agent is an end-to-end **Voice-to-Action** application integrated into the Smart TV OS. The user speaks naturally, the system understands the command, retrieves information if needed, executes the action on the TV, and responds using voice + UI.

### Core Capabilities

- Natural voice commands (hands-free control)
- Intelligent search (movies, actors, news, etc.)
- Launch and interact with apps
- Control system settings (volume, subtitles, brightness)
- Provide information and summaries when requested

### Why It Matters

- Creates a **smarter, more intuitive TV experience**
- Accessible for users with disabilities
- Faster navigation than remote controls
- A key innovation in the Smart TV OS project

## ✅ 2. How It Works (Pipeline)

```
Voice Input → ASR → NLU + Dialog Manager → Action Planner → App/System Control
                                     ↓

                                     ↓
                                   TTS Reply + UI
```

| Stage      | Component          | Purpose                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1          | STT/ASR            | Convert speech to text                        |

| 3          | Entity Extraction  | Detect titles, actors, etc.                   |
| 4          | Action Execution   | Search, play, launch apps, adjust settings    |
| 5          | RAG                | Fetch fresh information (e.g., news, ratings) |
| 6          | TTS                | Convert text to speech back to the user       |

## ✅ 4. Implementation Plan

### 📌 Phase 1 — Core Voice System (Weeks 1–4)

- **STT Integration:** Add Whisper ASR (local or API)
- **NLU/LLM:** Build NLU + **Intent classification model** for Play / Search / Settings
- **Data Collection & Annotation:** Gather training phrases from real usage for fine‑tuning
- TTS: Build a basic TTS response system
- **Action Planner Module:** Maps predicted intent → OS actions
- **System Control API Integration:** Connect Action Planner to TV OS services for execution, Integrate Speech-to-Text 

**Deliverable:** First demo of basic commands

---

### 📌 Phase 2 — App Integration & UI Responses & RAG (Weeks 5–8)

- Connect with YouTube (deep-link queries)
- Launch browser with results
- Control system settings 
- RAG: Retriever system and Vector DB for basic Q&A
- Display search results visually with selection
- Dialog Manager for yes/no confirmations

**Deliverable:** Full navigation + visible response demo

---

### 📌 Phase 3 — Intelligence Enhancements (Weeks 9–12)

- Optional: Cloud LLM for complex Q&A(performance, cost)
- Reduce Speech Noise in home environment
- Enhance RAG for complex Q&A
- Multi-user personalization & memory
- UX polish + latency improvements

**Deliverable:** Final polished demo for jury

## ✅ 5. Technologies & Tools

> **Strategy**: Prefer open‑source models first (fine‑tuning if required). Use closed‑source/cloud only if performance is insufficient.

- **ASR (STT):** Open‑source Whisper (local or API) / alternative Hugging Face(HF) models
- **NLU / LLM:** Open‑source Llama/Mistral models + Intent Classifier (Preferred Arabic Models)
- **Action Planner:** OS Control Service (custom)
- **TTS:** Open‑source HF TTS (e.g., VITS) then fallback to cloud TTS if needed
- **RAG (Future Upgrade):** FAISS vector DB + app/public API connectors
- **Programming Languages:** Python + OS SDK

## ✅ 5.1 System Architecture Diagram (High-Level)

```
🎤 Voice Input
        ↓
[ ASR (Whisper) ] — Converts speech → text
        ↓
[ NLU / LLM (Llama/Mistral) ] — Understands intent + entities
        ↓
[ Dialog & Action Planner ] — Decides what to do
        ↓
[ TV OS Control Service ] — Executes actions on system/apps
        ↓
📺 UI Feedback + 🔊 TTS Response
```

Cloud / Local Strategy:

- **Local GPU (preferred):** ASR, Intent Handling, Basic NLU
- **Cloud API (optional):** Complex reasoning, fallback TTS

A hybrid approach ensures **low latency** + **wide functionality**.

## ✅ 7. Demo Script (for presentation day)

Examples:

1. "Play the latest episode of Planet Earth" → plays content
2. "Open YouTube and search football highlights" → launches YouTube
3. "Turn subtitles on" → subtitles enabled
4. "What are critics saying about the new Batman movie?" → response summary

## 📊 Evaluating the STT Component

The `english_stt_optimized.py` module includes a helper method
`EnglishSTT.evaluate_dataset()` which computes **accuracy (via WER)** and
**latency** for a given set of audio samples and their reference
transcripts.  You can provide a simple dictionary in Python or load a CSV
with two columns (`audio`, `reference`).

```python
from english_stt_optimized import EnglishSTT

stt = EnglishSTT(model_size="base")
# dataset = {"file1.wav": "hello world", ...}
results = stt.evaluate_dataset(dataset)
print(results["average_accuracy"])
print(results["total_latency"])
```

You can also transcribe a **single audio file** and compute its accuracy
by passing the expected text as a `reference` parameter:

```python
trans = stt.transcribe_file("audio.wav", reference="expected text")
print(trans["text"], trans.get("accuracy"))
```


A small evaluation example is already shown in the `main()` function of
`english_stt_optimized.py` (look for the `sample_dataset` dictionary).
Simply replace the placeholder entries with your own audio files.
